    "You're probably coming here from the Physics StackOverflow question. I decided to add my own spin to some Higgs analysis, and ran into a little trouble. I am trying to get the invariant mass for each electron in the 2011 4e data, first making the attempt with one electron. My invariant masses are about 10 GeV away from the expected value of 0.0005 GeV."

I did participate in _some_ collaboration with LHC groups.

Let's just say it lets us get away with writing equations and measurements without including the defining constants, which include $c$. If you want to know more, you can also look up [nondimensionalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondimensionalization) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230316040337/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondimensionalization))); I'm guessing you probably _don't_ want to know more, or even as much as I've said.<br/>\n",

    "That shows our electron invariant mass to be -8.520275 (GeV). I can live with the invariant mass being negative. I think that means it's an antiparticle (positron, a.k.a. anti-electron, in this case). However, our invariant mass should, in that case, be -0.0005. (The invariant masses of the Z-bosons and the Higgs show up in GeV - natural units again - so I would expect that of the electron to do the same. I don't know how the invariant masses of the Z-bosons would be close to correct, but those of the electrons wouldn't be correct. The electrons are observed, so they shouldn't be off-mass-shell at all. I think I'll at least try with the other three particles. If they all seem weird, it will be off to Physics StackExchange."
